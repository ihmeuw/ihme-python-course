    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Broadly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Officially, Python is an interpreted scripting language (meaning that it is not compiled until it is run) for the C programming language; in fact, Python itself is coded in C (though there are other non-C implementations). It offers the power and flexibility of lower level (*i.e.* compiled) languages, without the steep learning curve and associated programming overhead. The language is very clean and readable, and it is available for almost every modern computing platform."
